What is git?

---

git is distributed version control

---

git is the common language of open source software

---

git is Github

---

Distributed version control allows for anonymous, asynchronous open source
collaboration.

---

Github made Pull Requests easy.

---

# Vocabulary

---

## Repo/Repository

Any instance of a git repository. Could be remote, or local on your
workstation. Generally refers to the remote repository.

---

## Clone

Local copy of a repository, which is cloned from a remote repository.

---

## Fork

Remote copy of a remote repository. You might not have push access to a remote
repository, so you create a copy of it that you control. This is your fork.

---

## Remote

Different destination repositories which have been configured for interaction
on a local clone. Common naming examples: `origin` or `upstream`

---

## origin

The default name for the original clone location or primary remote repository.
Usually will be configured to point at your fork.

## upstream

The standard name for the remote that points to the remote repository from
which you forked.

* `origin` would be `basepi/hubble`
* `upstream` would be `hubblestack/hubble`

---

## branch

Pointer to a specific commit in the tree

---

## tree

![Tree](images/git-tree.png)

---

## commit

A git object with a content diff, hash, timestamp, and parent commit (two
parent commits if it's a merge commit)

---

# Let's fork a repo

https://git.corp.adobe.com/cmyers/git-training

Notes:

- Fork the repo
- Clone the repo
- Add origin/upstream
- git remote -v

---

# Why is this important?

---

You might not control the repository

---

Even if you do, you want to keep upstream clean

---

`push -f` and `rebase` to your heart's content!

---

# Let's talk about getting work done

---

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b mycoolfeature upstream/master
```

---

```bash
git fetch upstream
git branch mycoolfeature upstream/master
git checkout mycoolfeature
```

---

(yes, there are other ways you can do this cleanly)

↓

--

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
git checkout -b mycoolfeature
```

--

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git reset --hard upstream/master
git push origin master
git checkout -b mycoolfeature
```

---

Once you have your branch, you need to do some work.

---

Committing is (technically) a two-step process

---

# Staging

Changes which have been added to git and are ready to commit

---

```
git status
```

---

```
git reset
```

---

```
git add
```

↓

--

# Bonus

```
git add -p
```

---

```
git commit -v
```

---

```
git commit -a -v
```

---

```
git commit -a -m <message>
```

↓

--

Get in the habit of avoiding `-m`, it will make your commit messages better

--

```
export EDITOR=vim
```

--

`-v` is your friend!

---

# Pushing your work

---

```
git push origin mycoolfeature
```

---

Always specify remote and branch!

Don't rely on your tracking branches being set up correctly.

---

# Opening a PR

---

# Reviewing a PR

---

You can set up protected branches to force PRs and reviews

---

# Conflicts!

---

Rebase is (sometimes) your friend

---

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

---

```
git push origin mycoolfeature
```

---

```
git push -f origin mycoolfeature
```

---

Merges are fine too. (Unless they're not)

---

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
<resolve conflicts>
<commit resolution>
git push origin mycoolfeature
```

Note that you don't have to us `-f` if you use merge, which is an advantage
