What is git?

git is distributed version control

git is the common language of open source software

git is Github

Distributed version control allows for anonymous, asynchronous open source
collaboration.

---

Github made Pull Requests easy.

# Vocabulary

---

## Repo/Repository

Any instance of a git repository. Could be remote, or local on your
workstation. Generally refers to the remote repository.

---

## Clone

Local copy of a repository, which is cloned from a remote repository.

---

## Fork

Remote copy of a remote repository. You might not have push access to a remote
repository, so you create a copy of it that you control. This is your fork.

---

## Remote

Different destination repositories which have been configured for interaction
on a local clone. Common naming examples: `origin` or `upstream`

---

## origin

The default name for the original clone location or primary remote repository.
Usually will be configured to point at your fork.

## upstream

The standard name for the remote that points to the remote repository from
which you forked.

* `origin` would be `basepi/hubble`
* `upstream` would be `hubblestack/hubble`

---

## branch

Pointer to a specific commit in the tree

---

## tree

![Tree](images/git-tree.png)

---

## commit

A git object with a content diff, hash, timestamp, and parent commit (two
parent commits if it's a merge commit)

---

# Let's fork a repo

https://git.corp.adobe.com/compute-services-team/git-training

Notes:

- Fork the repo
- Clone the repo
- Add origin/upstream
- git remote -v

---

# Why is this important?

---

You might not control the repository

---

Even if you do, you want to keep upstream clean

---

`push -f` and `rebase` to your heart's content!

---

# Let's talk about getting work done

---

`git fetch upstream`

---

`git checkout -b mycoolfeature upstream/master`

---

`git branch mycoolfeature upstream/master`

`git checkout mycoolfeature`

---

(yes, there are other ways you can do this cleanly)

Notes:

* `git checkout master`
* `git pull upstream master`
* `git push origin master`
* `git checkout -b <new_branch>`
